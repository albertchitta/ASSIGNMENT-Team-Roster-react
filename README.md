## Code Snippet <!-- OPTIONAL, but doesn't hurt -->
The useEffect hook is used to check dependency values from the last render.
```
  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    if (isMounted) {
      if (player.firebaseKey) {
        setFormInput({
          name: player.name,
          number: player.number,
          firebaseKey: player.firebaseKey,
          position: player.position,
          imageUrl: player.imageUrl,
          uid: user.uid,
        });
      }
    }
    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [player]);
